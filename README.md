# Package for symbolic calculations with quaternions.

Quaternions package implements Hamiltonâ€™s quaternion algebra.
This package mimics original Mathematica Quaternions.m, however,
it fixes various bugs and also allows symbolic transformations
of quaternions to more extent than Mathematica's original.
